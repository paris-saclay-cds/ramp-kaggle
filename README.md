RAMP Kaggle
===========

This library serves as the interface between the results computed with ramp-autods and Kaggle, using the Kaggle API.

# Installation

In the root directory, run
```
pip install .
```

You need to be registered on Kaggle and follow the [Authentication instructions of the Kaggle API](https://www.kaggle.com/docs/api). This will create a `kaggle.json` file with your API credentials.
